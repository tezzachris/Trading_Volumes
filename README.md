# Trading Volumes

We predict the daily trading volumes for several stocks using different approaches:

1) Linear regression
2) Poisson regression
3) Time series: ARIMA, SETAR
4) Trees: Gradient Boosting (catboost, scikit-learn)

For each approach we compare the out-of-sample performance on different sets.
